# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Determine if the data differs by city type and how the results can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results Summary
In our findings, we can clearly see that Urban cities have an overall higher usage and spending amount compared to Rural and Suburban cities across the board, however, the average fare per driver is significantly less than those in Rural and Suburban cities. Let's dive into what might be the best course of action for continued longterm success.

## Results
1. Urban cities have a significantly higher amount of drivers.
    - Urban cities have 2,405 drivers
    - Suburban cities have 490 drivers
    - Rural cities have 78 drivers
2. Urban cities have the most total rides.
    - Urban cities had 1,625 total rides
    - Suburban cities had 625 total rides
    - Rural cities had 125 total rides
3. Urban cities have higher total fares due to the large number of rides.
    - Urban cities had 1,625 total rides
    - Suburban cities had 625 total rides
    - Rural cities havd 125 total rides
4. Urban cities have the cheapest fare average compared to others.
    - Urban cities have an average of $24.53 per ride.
    - Suburban cities have an average of $30.97 per ride.
    - Rural cities have an average of $34.62 per ride.
5. Urban cities have the lowest fare average per Driver compared to others.
    - Urban cities have an average of $16.57 per driver.
    - Suburban cities have an average of $39.50 per driver.
    - Rural cities have an average of $55.49 per driver.

## Challenge Summary
Typically, Urban areas due to being a denser community, have a greater population of people needing to get around. Because of this, there are typically less people that have a vehicle in their household, and using PyBer is their main source of transportation. This leads to a need for more drivers, and a lesser need to increase the fare per ride.
Suburban and Rural areas typically consist of households that have at least one vehicle in their household. This decreases the need for them to rely on PyBer for their regular commutes compared to Urban cities. Suburban and Rural areas are more likely to use PyBer to travel into the Urban city areas to get around, due to the need for parking and other downfalls of driving in busier Urban cities.

Recommendations for addressing the disparities among the city types.
1. Lower fare cost for Suburban and Rural cities. This will increase usage of PyBer which could lead to an increased need to have more drivers in these cities which can help lead to increased profits.
2. Lower fare average per driver for Rural and Suburban cities. With the average fare per driver at $40 or more, this decreases the need for drivers to be available for longer periods of time. If we were to decrease the fare per driver, then there is more incentive for them to be available more often to make up that difference. This would also help lead to having more drivers readily available in the Suburban and Rural areas.
3. Slight increase in Urban fares; this is a fine line that would need to be addressed with caution. More commonly in Urban cities are lower income households, if the fare is raised too signifcantly, this could lead to those who rely on PyBer for transportation to seek other alternative options due to the increased cost. I would recommend researching further into a realistic increased amount in fares in Urban cities.
